## Hi, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with an educational background in computer science and a hands-on full-stack bootcamp.

I am a dedicated, hard-working, quick learner who always aims to exceed expectations. Fueled by an unwavering love for problem-solving, a passion for excellence, and a relentless pursuit of improvement to every project.

My past includes three years of pursuing a computer science degree, earning around 80 credits. Recognizing my need for a more hands-on learning environment to learn a specific set of skills, I chose to enroll in a coding bootcamp. I have also worked in movie theaters for a total of three years and was a highly valued team member at each location. I received the team member of the month award during the opening month of a movie theater, which at the time had around 70 employees.

Hobbies:
- Playing video games
- Watching movies/shows/videos
- Bouldering
