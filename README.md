## Hi, I'm Jonathan ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with an educational background in computer science and a hands-on full-stack bootcamp.

My past includes going to college for 3 years for a computer science degree. I decided to learn a specific set of skills rather than the basics of many topics, so I decided to seek a coding bootcamp. I have also worked in movie theaters for 3 years and was a highly valued team member. I received team member of the month for the opening month of a movie theater. 

I am sharp and can pick things up surprisingly quickly. I am dedicated and hard-working.  

Hobbies:
- Playing video games
- Watching movies/shows/videos
- Bouldering
